## About

This is a to-do list app built with HTML, CSS & Vanilla JavaScript

The purpose behind this project is to reinforce the structure necessary for accessibility

The project thus utilizes:

- Proper heirarchical structure needed for assistive technology such as screen-readers, speech input & keyboard compatibility.
- Usage of the `tabindex` attribute to manage keyboard focus
- Aria labels necessary for elements to be read by assistive technology

## [Try it out](https://stephnitis.github.io/a11y-todo/)

- Use your keyboard to see focus change to and from actionable items on the page
- Tab key moves forward through the elements
- Shift tab will reverse to the previously focused item
- Space bar to press buttons or check items on list
